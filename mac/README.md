## Build scripts for Mac OS

### Prerequisites

Install Xcode from the Apple AppStore (free of charge).
Install Qt for Mac OS.
Sample download link for [Qt 5.7.0](http://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.7/5.7.0/qt-opensource-mac-x64-clang-5.7.0.dmg).

### Files

- build-mac.sh : Bash script to build the installer. Run it from a terminal.

### Using the installer

The generated file is a `.dmg` image, like most Mac OS installers.
Double-click on this file from the Finder.
The volume image is mounted and opened in the Finder.
Simply drag the *Qt Linguist* icon and drop it into the *Applications* icon to install Qt Linguist.

Qt Linguist can now be started from the *Launch Pad*.
